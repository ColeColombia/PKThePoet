      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Love is a verb</h1>
      <p>
And so love on it's own is a verb
Of so even the laziest man fails <br>to not work hard and run crazily to
 prove himself<br>
He's blind cannot see how dump he has become<br>
Even after being told<br>
His tears are not of sadness but love cherishing out of his deep soul<br>
He's not a thief<br>
And with no reason to look over his shoulders<br>
He does for the other with excellent service<br>
He does for the other beyond limit<br>
He does for the other with no care of who passed this road before him<br>
As he's is in good intention<br>
Of not only to prove to the beloved<br>
But to feed too his almost died soul in disbelief of love<br>
He flies unknowingly<br>
And at a surprise he too fails to recognize himself<br>
Though that doesn't bother him<br>
As long as his beloved smiles and recognizes this stranger who lives to progress the heart of her<br>
He is not tired ever<br>
Every morning plants another flower<br>
And yet another till there's no land<br>
He spends on his last fortunes to see smile on hers<br>
Because even if he hungers that's how his soul feeds<br>
That's how his soul fulls<br>
And all that is enough<br>
He loves every second<br>
And reminds every second of his love<br>
Because though he loses and lost himself<br>
His fear still remains<br><br>
Who will he be if he woke up without her<br>
Who would he be if his words can't be told to her<br>
Who would he become if not a big truck to help her carry her burdens<br>
Who would he be if no longer a warm shelter for her heart<br>
So I still say love is a verb<br>
For so even the clueless man finds a way to work around it<br>
That he does not seek a manual<br>
As he does his absolute best<br>
For he's clueless but does not wait to be reminded<br>
So he works his best and hopes it works<br>
Just so she stays and rests<br>
Love on it's own is a verb<br>
For even the most strongest man that can fight<br>
Puts down his swords<br>
Gets out of his own ring<br>
And learns how to fight<br>
Not for money but her heart<br>
He outlearns his ways of fight<br>
As his heart gentles down to this sweet melody of her face<br>
He bows down at everyones surprise to please her without remorse<br>
And so love is a doing word❤️.</p>
